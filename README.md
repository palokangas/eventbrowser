## Information 

This is a client for [Menomeno API](https://github.com/palokangas/menomeno/), providing
browsing of events, adding and editing resources. It is a fairly general [CollectionJSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/) API browser but has been customized to provide nicer user experience for this particular domain.

To run the app, you need to have MenomenoAPI running somewhere, domain pointed
to that API in index.js, and then you can run the app with:

### `npm start`

## TODO

* Implement nicer user experience using more controlled state management (using Redux)
* Wait for Menomeno API to evolve and have this client adapt :-)
